- How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
- How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
- How do I approach designing software?

Software developers can take steps to ensure programs are secure and effective, but they cannot guarantee them to be reliable and functional at all times. A program must be thoroughly reviewed for any vulnerabilities in its code and dependencies, tested extensively to verify that it runs as intended and be given proper maintenance in due time. In order to test the application, specifications should be used based on the client's vision. Starting with the micro level, testing gradually includes more and more of the program until clients and users can use it. Unit testing is typically done first, followed by integration, system, and acceptance testing.

Before and during development, clients and potential users are usually asked questions for further clarifications. Additionally, clients can approve or deny new features the Team has been discussing; the best approach is to clear any misunderstandings early before moving on to the next feature.

Before you can think about how to solve a problem, you need to understand it fundamentally. To design software for a particular problem, it is necessary to understand what the problem is. Understanding what the client is trying to accomplish and how to solve it efficiently is key to designing software for them.
